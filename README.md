# Irrigated Area Detector

The IA Detector is a project that aims to facilitate the mapping of irrigated land areas in semi-arid regions using the Google Earth Engine Python API.
The code within this repository allows you to apply our methodology for the mapping of irrigated land areas to the area and time period of your choosing.

## Requirements
A Google Earth Engine account is required to access the Google Earth Engine Python API. More information on how to sign up can be found *[here](https://earthengine.google.com/)*
Additionaly, the monthdelta python package needs to be installed. This package can be installed via pip by running the following line:

     pip install monthdelta

## Installation
You can clone the repository by running the following line

    git clone https://github.com/Remdeht/ia_detector

## Tutorial
A Colab notebook giving a walkthrough of the methodology can be found *[here](https://github.com/Remdeht/ia_detector/blob/master/IA_Classification_Script.ipynb)*
